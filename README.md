# Hypothyroid-Disease-Prediction
This is a project focused on determination of a patient having hypothyroidism.
The goal is to have a comprehensive model that can determine the condition of a patient(whether they have hypothyroidism of not) based on the symptoms found.
I am going to use Support Vector Machine and Decision tree models for my project.

# Project Description
Hypothyroidism, also know as underactive thyroid, is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages but over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.
It is thus important for the disease to be diagnosed early.
The goal for this project is to develop a model that will predict presence of the disease based off on the symptoms found in the patient.
Nairobi Hospital has conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected is focused on thyroid patients. It is from this data that I am going to derive and conclude the best model for use.

# Technologies Used
